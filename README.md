# GridSearchCV Example with scikit-learn

This repository demonstrates how to use `GridSearchCV` from scikit-learn for hyperparameter tuning with a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) on the Iris dataset.

## Overview

`GridSearchCV` is a powerful tool for finding the optimal hyperparameters for a machine learning model. It systematically searches through a predefined grid of hyperparameter values and evaluates the model's performance using cross-validation. This example showcases its application with an SVC on the classic Iris dataset.
